# Statistics for Data Science

## Course Description
Explored fundamental statistical concepts, including manipulating and cleaning different data types, inference sampling, probabilistic conclusions, and hypothesis testing to validate findings. I implemented both simple and multivariable linear regression, with a particular emphasis on distinguishing their applications in statistics vs. machine learning. Additionally, I gained mastery in A/B testing concepts throughout the course. All concepts were actively applied using the open-source software R.
