# Statistics For Data Science
**Course number : INFO70279**

Course Accomplishments:
In this course, I explored fundamental statistical concepts, covered diverse data types, employed sampling for inference, used probability for drawing conclusions, and conducted hypothesis testing to validate findings. I applied both simple and multivariable linear regression, with a focus on differentiating their applications in statistics versus machine learning. Furthermore, I mastered A/B testing concepts in the course. All of the concepts were applied using the open-language software R.
